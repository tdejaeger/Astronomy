# Code to do K-S-MW correction at the same time

## 1) Background

The photon flux observed in one photometric system is affected by different sources: the dust in our Milky Way (AvG), the expansion of the Universe (K-correction; Oke & Sandage 1968; Hamuy et al. 1993; Kim et al. 1996; Nugent et al. 2002), and the host-galaxy extinction (Avh), and by the difference between the natural photometric system used to obtain observations and the standard photometric system (S-correction; Stritzinger et al. 2002).  

**1.1) Milky Way extinction**

Dust extinction in our Galaxy is due to small and solid grains of heavy elements formed in the core of massive stars and ejected in the interstellar medium by stellar winds and SN explosions (Draine 2003). Dust scatters and absorbs more blue light than red light, and therefore SNe with large extinction will be characterised by a redder continuum. To correct for AvG, we can use the value derived by Schlafly & Finkbeiner (2011).
