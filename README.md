# Astronomy

In the folder Codes you can find a library of Python codes used during my research and
mostly written by me.

In the folder Hubble constant,you can find an example of how to measure the Hubble-Lemaitre Constant, by building a hierarchical model for the distance ladder and ultimately using SNe Ia as standard candles.
This exercice is taken from the Ay128: Undergraduate Data Science Lab at Berkeley done by Prof. Dan Weiz.
