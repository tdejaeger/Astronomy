# Astronomy

In the folder Codes you can find a library of Python codes used during my research and
mostly written by me.

## Hubble constant  

In the folder Hubble constant, you can find my solution to the problem proposed by **Prof. Dan Weiz.** in this lecture **Ay128: Undergraduate Data Science Lab** at Berkeley.  Here I will show how to measure the Hubble-Lemaitre constant, by building a hierarchical model for the distance ladder and ultimately using SNe Ia as standard candles.  


**Technical skills**: 

+ hierarchical modeling
+ efficiently sampling high dimensional models
+ STAN
+ EMCEE
+ more sophisticated
+ time series fitting
+ systematic vs. random errors
