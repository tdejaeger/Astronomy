# Astronomy

### 1.) Codes  

In the folder Codes you can find a library of Python codes used during my research and
mostly written by me.

**1.1) Medley**

+ Spectroscopy: Blackbody fitting, continuum fitting, Halpha Gaussian decomposition  
+ Photometry: Light curve fitting (slope), Light curve regression using Gaussian Process, maximum fitting   
+ Extinction: Cardelli coefficient, spectrum deredenning, host galaxy extinction (Balmer)  
+ Others: Fate to MJD, extract SN information from webpages  

**1.2) LSST_sim**
+ Simulation to estimate the distribution in redshift of Type II supernovae that LSST will discover assuming a limiting magnitude  

**1.3) Mangling**
+ Color-matching function (mangling/warping) to adjust the spectrum continuum to have the same colour as the SN photometry  


### 2) Current expansion rate of the Universe  
~~~~
In the folder Hubble constant, you can find my solution to derive the expansion rate of the Universe using the data from Riess et al. 2016. This problem was proposed by Prof. Dan Weiz during the Ay128: Undergraduate Data Science Lab lecture at Berkeley. Here, I will measure the Hubble constant, by building a hierarchical model for the distance ladder and ultimately using SNe Ia as standard candles.

**Technical skills**: 

+ hierarchical modeling
+ efficiently sampling high dimensional models
+ STAN
+ EMCEE
+ more sophisticated time series fitting
+ systematic vs. random errors
